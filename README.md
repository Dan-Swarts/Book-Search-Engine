## Description

This web application integrates with the Google Books API to search for books based on user input. Users can search for titles, authors, or keywords, and the application fetches relevant book details from the API. The retrieved book information is then stored in a mongoDB database for easy access and management. This project showcases the use of GraphQL API calls, database management, and efficient handling of external API responses in a streamlined workflow.
